# Muon_magnets

A project to simulate muon relaxation functions as observed in muon spectroscopy.

A grid of dipoles is created so that the resultant magnetic field can be sampled at any point in 3d space around it
Muons can be scattered over the grid and the resulting asymmetry function calculated and compared to experimental data

# Aim of the project
Recreate muon relaxation functions and prove that a model based on currently used assumptions in muon spectrosopy will replicate experimental results.
